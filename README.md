# Cargo-unloading-Arduino-bot
The code file contains C++ code compatible with the Arduino IDE software.
The code controls a line following bot, which unloads cargo after completing an upslope track.

There is a Cad file (compatible with Fusion360) and a file for laser cutting (compatible with LaserCad)


## Problem Statement

Design and build a vehicle that can climb the track shown in Fig. 1 while carrying
a given payload (300 gm maximum) from Point P1 to Point P2, and then dump/unload the payload in the
area marked as the ‘delivery area’. The payload will be in the form of pebbles (see Fig. 2). The track will
have a line marking along the center and barrier walls on either sides.
